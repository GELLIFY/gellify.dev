## [The GELLIFY Stack](/docs/introduction#the-gellify-stack)

The **GELLIFY Stack** is a modern web development stack designed for **simplicity, modularity, and full-stack TypeScript safety**. Created and refined by [Matteo Badiniâ†—](https://x.com/badini_matteo) and the GELLIFY team, it brings together battle-tested technologies to help developers build **scalable, maintainable, and performant applications** with minimal friction.

At its core, the stack relies on **[Next.jsâ†—](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScriptâ†—](https://typescriptlang.org/)**, providing a robust foundation for full-stack development. For UI, **[shadcn/uiâ†—](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** and **[Tailwind CSSâ†—](https://tailwindcss.com/)** deliver a flexible and accessible design system. When it comes to backend capabilities, **[Neonâ†—](https://neon.tech/)** (a serverless PostgreSQL with branching and autoscaling), **[Drizzleâ†—](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** (a type-safe ORM), and **[Clerkâ†—](https://clerk.com/)** (a managed authentication service) streamline the process of managing data and users effortlessly.

This stack is intentionally **modular**. Need authentication? Use Clerk. Want a different ORM? Swap out Drizzle. The goal is to **empower developers with best-in-class defaults while keeping things customizable**.

## Soâ€¦ what is `create-gellify-app`? A template?

Yes! `create-gellify-app` is more than just a templateâ€”itâ€™s a **curated starting point** for building modular, full-stack applications quickly. Developed from years of experience, it encodes best practices and proven architectural choices into a **streamlined, production-ready setup**.

Each piece of the stack is **optional**, allowing you to customize it based on your needs. Weâ€™ve distilled countless hours of development into this template, so you donâ€™t have to start from scratch.

This is **not** a one-size-fits-all solution. Youâ€™re encouraged to bring your own tools for things like **state management or deployment**, but we do offer recommendations based on our experience.

## GELLIFY Axioms

We take a strong stance on a few core principles that shape how we build. These guide our decisions and ensure that **`create-gellify-app` remains a reliable, scalable foundation**.

### ðŸ›  Solve Real Problems

We donâ€™t believe in **adding everything** for the sake of it. Every tool in `create-gellify-app` **solves a real problem** within the core stack. Thatâ€™s why youâ€™ll find Clerk (authentication) and Neon (database), but not a state management library like Reduxâ€”because state management varies widely by project.

### âš¡ Bleed Responsibly

We love using cutting-edge technologyâ€”but we do it **wisely**. We wonâ€™t gamble on unproven database tech (SQL works great!), but we **do** embrace innovations like **shadcn/ui**, which can be swapped out easily. Our philosophy: **experiment where itâ€™s safe, be pragmatic where it matters.**

### ðŸ”’ Typesafety Is Non-Negotiable

Typesafety isnâ€™t just a featureâ€”itâ€™s a **core value**. `create-gellify-app` is built to ensure a **fully type-safe experience**, minimizing bugs and maximizing productivity. If a decision **compromises TypeScript safety**, it doesnâ€™t belong here.

## Why We Built This

At GELLIFY, weâ€™ve worked on countless projects, refining our approach over time. This stack is the resultâ€”a **developer-friendly, production-ready foundation** that lets you focus on building **great products** instead of wrestling with setup and architecture. ðŸš€
