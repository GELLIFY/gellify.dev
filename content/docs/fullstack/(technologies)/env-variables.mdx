# Environment Variables

Create GELLIFY App uses its own package [@t3-oss/env-nextjs↗](https://env.t3.gg/) along with [zod↗](https://zod.dev/) under the hood for validating environment variables at runtime and buildtime by providing a simple logic in `src/env.js`.

## env.js

_TLDR;_ If you want to add a new environment variable, you must add a validator for it in `src/env.js`, and then add the KV-pair in `.env`

```tsx
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-nextjs";
import { z } from "zod";

export const env = createEnv({
  /**
   * Specify your server-side environment variables schema here. This way you can ensure the app
   * isn't built with invalid env vars.
   */
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url("not a valid db url"),
    NODE_ENV: z
      .enum(["development", "test", "production"])
      .default("development"),
  },

  /**
   * Specify your client-side environment variables schema here. This way you can ensure the app
   * isn't built with invalid env vars. To expose them to the client, prefix them with
   * `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
   */
  client: {
    // NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR: z.string(),
  },

  /**
   * You can't destruct `process.env` as a regular object in the Next.js edge runtimes (e.g.
   * middlewares) or client-side so we need to destruct manually.
   */
  runtimeEnv: {
    DATABASE_URL: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  },
  /**
   * Run `build` or `dev` with `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION` to skip env validation. This is especially
   * useful for Docker builds.
   */
  skipValidation: !!process.env.SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION,
  /**
   * Makes it so that empty strings are treated as undefined. `SOME_VAR: z.string()` and
   * `SOME_VAR=''` will throw an error.
   */
  emptyStringAsUndefined: true,
});
```

T3 Env uses the `createEnv` function to create the schema validate both client and server-side environment variables

## Using Environment Variables

When you want to use your environment variables, you can import them from the created `env.js` and use them as you would normally do. If you import this on the client and try accessing a server-side environment variable, you will get a runtime error.

```ts
import { env } from "../../env.js";

// `env` is fully typesafe and provides autocompletion
const dbUrl = env.DATABASE_URL;
```

```tsx
import { env } from "../env.js";

// ❌ This will throw a runtime error
const dbUrl = env.DATABASE_URL;

// ✅ This is fine
const wsKey = env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_KEY;
```

## .env.example

Since the default `.env` file is not committed to version control, we have also included a `.env.example` file, in which you can optionally keep a copy of your `.env` file with any secrets removed. This is not required, but we recommend keeping the example up to date to make it as easy as possible for contributors to get started with their environment.

Some frameworks and build tools, like Next.js, suggest that you store secrets in a `.env.local` file and commit `.env` files to your project. This is not recommended, as it could make it easy to accidentally commit secrets to your project. Instead, we recommend that you store secrets in `.env`, keep your `.env` file in your `.gitignore` and only commit `.env.example` files to your project.

## Adding Environment Variables

To ensure your build never completes without the environment variables the project needs, you will need to add new environment variables in two locations:

📄 `.env`: Enter your environment variable like you would normally do in a `.env` file, i.e. `KEY=VALUE`

📄 `env.js`: Add the appropriate validation logic for the environment variables by defining a Zod schema inside `createEnv` for each one, e.g. KEY: `z.string()`. Besides that, make sure to destruct them in the runtimeEnv option, e.g.: KEY: `process.env.KEY`

> ℹ️ Why do I need to destructure the environment variable in the runtimeEnv? This is due to how Next.js bundles environment variables in certain runtimes. By destructuring it manually, you ensure that the variable will never be stripped out from the bundle.

Optionally, you can also keep `.env.example` updated:

📄 `.env.example`: Enter your environment variable, but be sure to not include the value if it is secret, i.e. `KEY=VALUE` or `KEY=`

## Example

I want to add my Twitter API Token as a server-side environment variable

1. Add the environment variable to `.env`:

```
TWITTER_API_TOKEN=1234567890
```

2. Add the environment variable to `env.js`:

```ts
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-nextjs";
import { z } from "zod";

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    TWITTER_API_TOKEN: z.string(),
  },
  // ...
  runtimeEnv: {
    // ...
    TWITTER_API_TOKEN: process.env.TWITTER_API_TOKEN,
  },
});
```

3. _Optional_: Add the environment variable to `.env.example` and make sure not to include the secret in the `runtimeEnv` option

```
TWITTER_API_TOKEN=
```

## Type coercion

All variables you add to `.env` will be imported as strings, even if their value is intended to represent a different type. If you want to use your environment variables as a different type at runtime, you can use Zod’s coerce to convert the string to the type you want. It will throw if the coercion fails.

Add the variables to your `.env`:

```
SOME_NUMBER=123
SOME_BOOLEAN=true
```

Then, validate them in `env.js`:

```js
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-nextjs";
import { z } from "zod";

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    SOME_NUMBER: z.coerce.number(),
    SOME_BOOLEAN: z.coerce.boolean(),
  },
  // ...
  runtimeEnv: {
    SOME_NUMBER: process.env.SOME_NUMBER,
    SOME_BOOLEAN: process.env.SOME_BOOLEAN,
  },
});
```
