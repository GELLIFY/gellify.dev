# Shadcn/ui

Choosing the right component library is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and accessible applications. After evaluating several options, we selected **shadcn/ui** as our primary UI component library. This decision was based on multiple factors, including developer experience (DX), accessibility, design flexibility, AI-assisted development, and distribution efficiency.
Let's go over the key benefits

## Key Benefits

### üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Experience (DX)

shadcn/ui enhances developer productivity with:

- **Unopinionated, customizable components**: Unlike traditional UI libraries that enforce a strict design system, shadcn/ui provides flexible components that can be easily tailored.
- **Built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS**: Ensuring strong typing, better maintainability, and seamless integration with modern styling methodologies.
- **No external runtime dependencies**: Components are shipped as code, meaning no additional runtime libraries are required, reducing bundle size and performance overhead.

### üßë‚Äçü¶Ø Accessibility (a11y)

Accessibility is a core principle of shadcn/ui, with features such as:

- **Keyboard and screen reader support**: Ensuring compliance with WCAG standards out-of-the-box.
- **ARIA attributes and best practices**: Built-in support for accessible interactions without requiring additional configuration.
- **Customizability without compromising accessibility**: Unlike some rigid libraries, shadcn/ui allows developers to modify components while maintaining accessibility best practices.

### ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

shadcn/ui‚Äôs architecture is AI-friendly, making it easier for AI-powered tools to assist with development by:

- **Clear, structured component architecture**: Simplifies automated code generation and modifications.
- **Seamless integration with AI-driven coding tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT)**: Ensuring developers can efficiently generate, refactor, and debug components.
- **Minimal abstraction layers**: Allowing AI models to better understand and suggest improvements for UI logic and styling.

### üé® Design and Customization

shadcn/ui offers unparalleled flexibility for design teams by:

- **Not enforcing a predefined theme**: Making it adaptable to various design systems.
- **Easy token-based styling**: Enabling rapid customization without losing maintainability.
- **Supports dark mode and theming**: With built-in Tailwind utilities that simplify UI adjustments.

### üöÄ Efficient Distribution and Maintainability

Unlike monolithic UI frameworks, shadcn/ui optimizes distribution through:

- **Components as code**: Avoiding package dependency bloat.
- **Version-independent updates**: Since components are integrated into the codebase directly, updates don‚Äôt require dependency management headaches.
- **Better long-term maintainability**: Teams can evolve components without relying on third-party release cycles.

shadcn/ui provides the right balance of flexibility, accessibility, developer experience, and maintainability. Its component-as-code philosophy ensures that we have complete control over our UI, leading to a more efficient, scalable, and accessible development workflow. By adopting shadcn/ui, we empower our team to build high-quality, customizable interfaces without the overhead of rigid UI frameworks.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a tiny, [utility first‚Üó](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) CSS framework for building custom designs, without the context switching that regular CSS requires. It is purely a CSS framework and does not provide any pre-built components or logic, and provides [a very different set of benefits‚Üó](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQuTF-bkOgc) compared to a component library like Material UI.

It makes CSS incredibly easy and quick to write, as shown by the following example:

Old CSS:

1. Write CSS, often in a separate file

```css
.my-class {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #fff;
  border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

2. Import CSS into your component

```tsx
import "./my-class.css";
```

3. Add the class to your HTML

```html
<div class="my-class">...</div>
```

Equivalent in Tailwind:

1. Just write classes in your HTML

```html
<div
  class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center rounded border border-gray-200 bg-white p-4"
>
  ...
</div>
```

When used together with React Components, it is extremely powerful for quickly building UIs.

Tailwind CSS has a beautiful built-in design system, that comes out of the box with a carefully chosen color palette, sizing patterns for styles such as width/height and padding/margin for a uniform design, as well as media breakpoints for creating responsive layouts. This design system can be customized and extended to create the exact toolbox of styles that your project needs.

## Usage

Make sure you have editor plugins for Tailwind installed to improve your experience writing Tailwind.

### Extensions and Plugins

* [VSCode Extension‚Üó](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
* [JetBrains Integration‚Üó](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/tailwind-css.html#ws_css_tailwind_install)
* [Neovim LSP‚Üó](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#tailwindcss)

### Formatting

Tailwind CSS classes can easily get a bit messy, so a formatter for the classes is a must have. [Tailwind CSS Prettier Plugin‚Üó](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) sorts the classes in the [recommended order‚Üó](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted) so that the classes match the outputted css bundle. When selecting Tailwind in the CLI, we will install and configure this for you.

### Conditionally Applying Classes

Conditionally adding classes using ternaries can get very messy and hard to read. These packages help in organizing your classes when using some conditional logic.
