## [The GELLIFY Stack](/docs/introduction#the-gellify-stack)

The “GELLIFY Stack” is a web development stack made by [Matteo Badini↗](https://x.com/badini_matteo) focused on simplicity, modularity, and full-stack typesafety.

The core pieces are [Next.js↗](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript↗](https://typescriptlang.org/). [Shadcn/ui↗](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with [Tailwind CSS↗](https://tailwindcss.com/) is our building block for beautifull and accessible designs.
If you’re doing anything resembling backend, [Neon↗](https://neon.tech), [Drizzle↗](https://orm.drizzle.team/), and [Clerk↗](https://clerk.com/) are great additions too.

You may have noticed that there are a… lot of pieces. That’s by design. Swap pieces in and out as you need - this stack is modular at its core :)

## So… what is create-gellify-app? A template?

Yes! `create-gellify-app` is a template built by seasoned GELLIFY devs to streamline the setup of a modular new products.
This means each piece is optional, and the “template” can be customized on your specific needs.

After countless projects and many years on this tech, we have lots of opinions and insights. We’ve done our best to encode them into this template.

This is NOT an all-inclusive template. We expect you to bring your own libraries that solve the needs of YOUR application.
While we don’t want to prescribe solutions to more specific problems like state management and deployment, we do have some recommendations listed here.

## T3 Axioms

We’ll be frank - this is an opinionated project. We share a handful of core beliefs around building and we treat them as the basis for our decisions.

### Solve Problems

It’s easy to fall into the trap of “adding everything” - we explicitly don’t want to do that.
Everything added to `create-gellify-app` should solve a specific problem that exists within the core technologies included.
This means we won’t add things like state libraries (`zustand`, `redux`) but we will add things like Clerk and integrate Drizzle and Neon for you.

### Bleed Responsibly

We love our bleeding edge tech. The amount of speed and, honestly, fun that comes out of new shit is really cool.
We think it’s important to bleed responsibly, using riskier tech in the less risky parts.
This means we wouldn’t ⛔️ bet on risky new database tech (SQL is great!). But we happily ✅ bet on shadcn/ui since it’s just components that are trivial to move off.

### Typesafety Isn’t Optional

The stated goal of Create GELLIFY App is to provide the quickest way to start a new full-stack, typesafe web application.
We take typesafety seriously in these parts as it improves our productivity and helps us ship fewer bugs.
Any decision that compromises the typesafe nature of Create GELLIFY App is a decision that should be made in a different project.
