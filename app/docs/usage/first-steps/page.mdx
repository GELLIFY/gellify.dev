You just scaffolded a new GELLIFY App and are ready to go. Here is the bare minimum to get your app working.
First thing copy the `.env.example` into a new `.env`

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then follow the instruction below to fill the `.env` with the required pieces to get you started.

## Database

GELLIFY app will come with a `start-localstack.sh` bash script that can create a docker container with a database for local development.
If you already have a database, feel free to delete this file and put your database credentials in `.env`.

### Drizzle

The `.env` file in your project directory already contains a valid DB url for local development via Docker.
The first step is to run `pnpm db:push` to push your schema.

## Authentication

Your app includes Clerk, we get you started. This is one of the simplest providers, but it still requires a bit of initial setup on your part.
Of course, if you prefer to use a different auth provider, you can also opt-out of Clerk and use something link [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) instead.

You will need to:

1. Sign into Clerk
   [Create a Clerk account↗](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up) or [sign into the Clerk Dashboard↗](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).

2. Create a Clerk application
   If you've just created an account for the first time, you'll be taken directly to the interactive authentication setup form.
   Otherwise, you'll be redirected to the [Clerk Dashboard↗](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). To create a new app, select the **Create application** card.
   You'll be redirected to the interactive authentication setup form.

3. Select identifiers and social providers
   Once you are in the interactive authentication setup form, you will be asked to build your authentication flow.
   Here, Clerk provides various options for setting up your sign-up and sign-in flows. You can choose to use email, phone, or username as [identifiers](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers), and you can enable [social authentication providers](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview).
   Once the application is created, you can also customize your authentication flow by selecting different authentication strategies, verification methods, and more. [Learn more about sign-up and sign-in options](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options).

For production deployment, follow the [official documentation↗](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/overview#main)
