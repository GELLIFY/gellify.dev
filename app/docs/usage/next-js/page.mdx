# Next.js

Next.js is a backend framework for your React applications.

## Why should I use it?

We love React. It has made UI development accessible in ways we never imagined before.
It also can lead developers down some rough paths. Next.js offers a lightly opinionated, heavily optimized approach to creating applications using React.
From routing to API definitions to image rendering, we trust Next.js to lead developers towards good decisions.

Pairing Next.js with [Vercel↗](https://vercel.com/) makes developing and deploying web apps easier than ever before.
Their extremely generous free-tier and super intuitive interface provides a point and click solution to deploy your site (We ❤️ Vercel)
