# Recommendations

We recognize that the libraries included in `create-gellify-app` don’t solve every problem. While we encourage you to begin your project with the things that we provide, there will come a time when you need to bring in other packages. Only you can know what your project needs, but here are some things that we find ourselves recommending frequently.

These are recommendations by individual Create T3 App contributors and should not be seen as “official” endorsements by the Create T3 App team or T3-OSS. Please do your own research, especially before committing to paid services.

## State Management
Editor’s Note: State management libraries can be great, but often aren’t necessary. tRPC’s React Query hooks should be able to take care of your server state. For client state, start with React’s useState, and reach for one of these options when you need more.


## Animations
For when you need animations in your app, here are our recommendations.

### AutoAnimate

**For animations with a single line of code**

Most animation libraries try to satisfy every possible use case, and become clunky as a result. AutoAnimate is a zero-configuration tool that will give you a significant improvement in UX with no additional developer effort.

### Framer Motion

**For complex animations with declarative code**

Framer Motion provides a simple, declarative syntax and allows you to write less code to craft everything from complex animations to even gestures.

## Deployments, Infrastructure, Databases and CI

### Vercel

**For hosting your app**

Vercel took the hell of web deployments and made it a set-and-forget GitHub integration. We’ve scaled to hundreds of thousands of users without issue. AWS-powered, just a way better interface :)
